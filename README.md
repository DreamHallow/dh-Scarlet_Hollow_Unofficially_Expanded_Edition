# ABOUT THE PROJECT

<div align="left">
  
- This is Dream Hallow's Scarlet Hollow Unofficially Expanded Edition! Since it's a mouthful, it'll usually be shortened to SHUEE or just UEE.

- SHUEE is a solo project worked on by Dream Hallow. If you need to contact them about an issue with SHUEE, please do it in either the official Black Tabby Games Discord or on GitHub.

- SHUEE aims to increase the overall size of the game with more dialogue, both trait-related and unrelated, alongside new scenes and perhaps eventually new chapters.

If you want to try the mod, it's super easy! Just go to the releases section, where you can find the current version of the mod and patch notes for each version. Unzip the folder, drag the "game" folder into your install's .exe directory, and hit overwrite all files. All you should need to do is play the game!

- To uninstall, right-click on the game in your Steam library, go to properties, and "verify files."

- Please backup your saves. Improper installation or bugs that erase saves only happen once you know you've messed up.
